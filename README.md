In order to get these files running successfully, either of the directories must be ran through XAMPP. Once XAMPP is installed on your machine, save it to the "C:" so it is easier to find.
The directories must be saved inside the "htoc" directory. The exact path is as follows: C:\xampp\htdocs

Regarding the code I have created, I done it with the assistance of an article on Sourcecodester.com and a YouTube clip.

The link to the article I followed was: https://www.sourcecodester.com/tutorials/php/12726/php-login-and-registration-sqlite-using-pdo.html
This assisted me in creating a log in and registration form with PHP and SQLite3

The YouTube clip assisted me in adding code that mitigated sensitive data exposure by showing me and helping understand the password_hash() and the password_verify methods
